## Known Issues

- Hyphenated band names do not retain their hyphen when saved. (Issue with ActiveSupport's #titlecase method.) [[2015-01-30]](https://github.com/zulaica/concert_history/issues/2)
- Selecting "Update Venues" on the band page without a value selected throws a Sinatra server error. [[2015-02-01]](https://github.com/zulaica/concert_history/issues/1)

## To Do

- More Venue data (City, Still Open/Closed)
